- `TS-WAITSTART` to get notified when a wait starts
- `TS-NEWTARGETSTART` to get notified when a new target starts
- `TS-TARGETSTART` to get notified when a target starts

### Dome

- Added `dome/set-park-position` to set the park position
- Added `dome/park` to park the dome
- Added `dome/home` to find the home position

---

- Added a custom filter wheel driver, available as a websocket, to allow for remote filter change completion
- Bugfixes for `image/{index}`
- Fixed the mime type for jpg images (`image/jpg` -> `image/jpeg`)

## 2.2.0.0

From now on, breaking changes will always increment the minor version number (the second number 2.x.0.0).
Sorry for the breaking changes, but they are worth it!

- ⚠️ **Breaking** Removed `skipRescan` from `{device}/connect`. This is now always true.
- ⚠️ **Breaking** The response formats of ``{device}/connect` and `{device}/disconnect` have changed. These now only return `Connected` or `Disconnected`.
- Added `to` to `{device}/connect` to specify which device should be connected. If omitted, the currently selected device will be used. This is the behavior as it was in the previous versions.
- Added `{device}/rescan` to rescan for new devices.
- Added `{device}/list-available` to list all available devices.

---

- ⚠️ **Breaking** The mount does not automatically stop the movement anymore when disconnecting. This was causing issues with PHD and the 2 second delay should be enough as a safety measure.
- Fixed an issue where the API would show the wrong ip address
- Added the url parameter `save` to the `camera/capture` endpoint. This will save the image to the disk. This needs to be set, when capturing the image.
- Added `sequence/state`, a new sequence endpoint for retrieving information that is much more elaborate and also supports plugins.
- Added `sequence/edit`, which works similary to `profile/set-value`. Note that this mainly supports fields that expect simple types like strings, numbers etc, and may not work for things like enums or objects (filter, time source, ...). This is an **experimental** feature and may be unreliable or uncomplete.
- Added `mount/set-park-position`, which sets the current mount position as park position.
- Added `pause-alignment` and `resume-alignment` to the TPPA WebSocket.
- Added an option to create and cache thumbnails for images. This has to be enabled if you want to use the new thumbnail endpoint (`image/thumbnail`).
- Introduced `camera/capture/statistics` which analyses the captured image and returns stats like HFR, Stars, Median, ...

## 2.1.8.0

- ⚠️ **Breaking** `image/{index}` now includes more images. Every image that is recieved as a websocket event can now be loaded using this endpoint. This is because the `imageType`
  parameter was introduced. The endpoint doesn't use NINA's image history anymore, but instead uses the websocket history. This includes more images and will result in a more consistent experience.
  The issue with NINA's image history is, that it does not necessarily include all images, like calibration frames.

### Flats

- Added the following methods for capturing flats:
  - `flats/skyflat`
  - `flats/auto-brightness`
  - `flats/auto-exposure`
  - `flats/trained-dark-flat`
  - `flats/trained-flat`

These methods do exactly the same as their sequence instruction counterparts.

- Added `flats/status` to get the status of the flat taking process.
- Added `flats/stop` to stop the flat taking process.

### Mount

- Added `waitForResult` to `mount/slew` to wait for the slew to finish.
- Added `mount/slew/stop` to abort the current slew.
- Added a `mount` websocket channel to move the mount axis manually. This automatically stops all movement when the client disconnects as a safety measure to prevent any accidents.

### Image

- Added `imageType` to `image/{index}` and `image-history` to filter the images by type.
- Added `debayer` and `bayerPattern` to `image/{index}` to debayer the image.
- Added `IsBayered` to `IMAGE-SAVE` event (and `image-history`).
- Added `autoPrepare` to `image/{index}` to leave all processing up to NINA. Using this will result in the same image as the one you see in NINA

---

- Added `PROFILE-ADDED` and `PROFILE-REMOVED` events to get notified when the collection of profiles changes, `PROFILE-CHANGED` is sent when the active profile changes.

## 2.1.7.1

- ⚠️ **Breaking** Enums are now serialized as strings, check the documentation for concrete updates. Please note, that not everything might be updated correctly ⚠️
- **Added support for the Livestack plugin (>= 1.0.0.9)**
- `livestack/start` to start the livestack
- `livestack/stop` to stop the livestack
- `livestack/image/{target}/{filter}` to get the current stacked image for a given filter and target
- `STACK-UPDATED` event in the websocket added, to notify when a new image is available

- Added `waitForResult` to `framing/slew`
- Added `version` to the documentation, it was always there just not documented
- Added `application/plugins` to get a list of installed plugins

- Added a 1s delay to the `IMAGE-SAVE` event to give NINA a bit more time to finish up the image
- `image/{index}` now automatically retries the image retrieval 10 times with a 200ms delay between each try, if it fails to load the image (because it is in use for example)

- Fixed solving a capture image
- Fixed an issue where the slew failed if no image was loaded in the framing assistant. An image is now automatically loaded

## 2.1.6.0

- `framing/determine-rotation` added to determine the rotation from the camera
- `camera/set-binning` added to set the binning of the camera, the binning mode has to be supported by the camera
- `camera/capture`:
  - URL parameter `omitImage` added to ignore the captured image, use if only the platesolve result is of interest
  - URL parameter `stream` added to stream the image, content type will be either image/jpg or image/png
  - URL parameter `waitForResult` added to wait for the capture to finish and then return the result. All parameters which you would normally use together with `getResult` will apply here as well
- Added `stream` parameter to `image/{index}` to stream the image, content type will be either image/jpg or image/png
- Added `stream` parameter to `application/screenshot` to stream the image, content type will be either image/jpg or image/png
- New Websocket Events:
  - `FOCUSER-USER-FOCUSED`
  - `AUTOFOCUS-FINISHED`
  - `API-CAPTURE-FINISHED` is sent, when `camera/capture` finishes

## 2.1.5.0

- `mount/flip` added to perform a meridian flip, the flip will only be executed if it is needed
- `mount/slew` slews the mount to the specified ra and dec angles
- `dome/set-follow` to start or stop the dome following the mount
- `dome/sync` to start a sync of mount and scope
- `dome/slew` to slew the dome to the specified azimuth angle (degree)
- `DOME-SLEWED` and `DOME-SYNCED` added as new events in the websocket

## 2.1.4.0

- `guider/start` now accepts the parameter calibrate to force a calibration (true / false)
- Guider info now contains a State field indicating what the guider is currently doing
- `guider/clear-calibration` added to clear the current calibration
- `guider/graph` to get the last n guide steps as configured on the guide graph in NINA (in NINA you can set x to be 50, 100, 200 or 400)

## 2.1.3.0

- Added query parameter `skipRescan` to all connect endpoints, which can be used to skip the rescanning process resulting in a faster connection
- Some websocket events now include more information:
  - `FILTERWHEEL-CHANGED` includes the previous and new filter
  - `FLAT-BRIGHTNESS-CHANGED` includes the previous and new brightness
  - `SAFETY-CHANGED` includes the new status
- Added `factor`, `blackClipping`, `unlinked` parameters to `image/{index}` to configure the stretch parameters

## 2.1.2.0

**⚠️ THIS UPDATE REMOVES V1 SUPPORT ⚠️**

- ⚠️ **Breaking** Removed support for the deprecated v1 api ⚠️

## 2.1.0.\* (betas) and 2.1.1.0

I **heavily** advise everyone still using V1 to start using V2 as V1 is now deprecated and will be removed with the next minor version!
V2 will probably stay for a longer time now, I made some changes behind the scenes that will make it easier to add new features without breaking older versions.

The documentation for the [api](https://bump.sh/christian-photo/doc/advanced-api) and the [websockets](https://bump.sh/christian-photo/doc/advanced-api-websockets/) will be hosted externally from now on

- It is now possible to add the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header to make requests via javascript without proxies possible. This does pose a security vulnerability though, so make sure you only enable it when you need to. A proxy may be better suited when in production.
- Eventwatchers are now started independently of the api, therefore Events can still be retrieved using event-history even if the api wasn't running before.

### V2 Changes
